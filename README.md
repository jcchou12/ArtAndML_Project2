# ArtAndML_Project2

This is Project 2 for Art and ML. It uses parts of the Deep Dream from TensorFlow code that can be found at https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/deepdream.ipynb. It also uses the Strotss Style Transfer algorithm which can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pBfUg0HAiLkhqW_vqzR353TA5RGIBW98#scrollTo=JihukNAZk7bJ.

We combined the two algorithms and modified the data inputted and parameters to create new artwork.
